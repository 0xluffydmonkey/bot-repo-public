# TradeFinderBot — Multi-Backend Perps Bot

Algorithmic trading bot that monitors a private Telegram channel for trade signals and executes them on perpetuals backends through a venue adapter.

Includes a real-time web dashboard, Telegram control bot with InlineKeyboard interface, automatic position tracking with PnL alerts, manual trading and position management, and a multi-venue architecture.

---

## How the bot runs

The canonical start command is:

```bash
./start.sh
```

`start.sh` handles secrets file validation, Node binary resolution, and process launch. It resolves the backend directory from its own location — no hardcoded paths.

Which modules run is controlled entirely by `.env` feature toggles:

File: `backend/.env`

```env
ENABLE_SIGNAL_LISTENER=true   # Telegram MTProto listener (trade signals)
ENABLE_WEB=true               # Express + Socket.IO web dashboard
ENABLE_CONTROL_BOT=false      # Telegram control bot with InlineKeyboard
```

No CLI flags needed. The start command is always the same — `.env` decides the behavior.

In production, the bot runs as a systemd service (`bot-trader.service`) which calls `backend/start.sh` with no flags.

---

## Secrets strategy

Configuration is split into two files:

| File | Location | Contains | In repo? |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| `.env` | `backend/.env` | Non-secret config: trading limits, feature flags, file paths | Yes (no real secrets) |
| `bot-secrets.env` | `/opt/bot/secrets/bot-secrets.env` | Real secrets: RPC URL, Telegram credentials, bot token | Never |

The bot refuses to start if the secrets file is missing or contains any `SET_IN_SERVER_ONLY` placeholder.

See [.env.example](.env.example) for a fully documented reference of every variable.

## Execution and persistence flow

Signal and manual opens share the same execution core:

```text
Signal / Manual -> executeSignal -> PerpExecutionService -> persistenceService
```

`ManualTradeService.executeSignal()` performs venue capability checks, balance/risk validation, optional cost logging, execution through `perpService.openTrade()`, and then calls `persistenceService.recordTradeOpened()` asynchronously. Paper and live use the same high-level flow; the difference happens inside `PerpExecutionService`, which routes paper mode to `paperEngine` and live mode to the active venue adapter.

Close paths capture the current position snapshot, execute through `PerpExecutionService`, and then call `persistenceService.recordTradeClosed()` when a tracked position is available.

Persistence is intentionally fail-safe: `safeQuery()` never throws, persistence calls are detached from execution, and database failures are logged but do not block trade execution.

---

## Modes and persistence risk

Mode is derived from `PAPER_TRADING` in `src/config/index.js`:

| Env | Runtime mode |
|-----|--------------|
| `PAPER_TRADING=true` | `paper` |
| `PAPER_TRADING=false` | `live` |

In paper mode, `PerpExecutionService` routes execution, close, balance, snapshot, reduce, and TP/SL calls to `paperEngine`. In live mode, it routes those calls to the active venue adapter.

Critical: keep `PAPER_TRADING`, venue configuration, and operator expectations aligned. Mode inconsistency can write incorrect `mode` or `venue` metadata to persistence.

---

## Data model

The implemented persistence layer uses only these database tables:

| Table | Role |
|-------|------|
| `trades` | Source of truth for trade rows, including `bot_trade_ref`, status, mode, source, venue, prices, size, leverage, and realized PnL |
| `trade_events` | Event tracking layer for persistence lifecycle events |

Current event types emitted by `persistenceService`:

- `TRADE_OPEN_REQUESTED`
- `TRADE_OPEN_PERSISTED`
- `TRADE_CLOSE_REQUESTED`
- `TRADE_CLOSE_PERSISTED`
- `TRADE_PERSIST_FAILED`

No other database tables are part of the implemented persistence layer in this backend reference.

---

## Observability

Persistence logs use the `[PERSIST]` prefix. Inspect these logs to confirm database connectivity, insert/update success, fallback close paths, and zero-row updates.

`safeQuery()` swallows database errors by design and returns `null`; this keeps trading execution running but makes log inspection mandatory when validating persistence.

Known limitations:

- `trade_events` depends on database availability and schema correctness.
- persistence failures are non-fatal and can be silent from the operator UI unless logs are inspected.
- mode or venue misconfiguration can produce incorrect persistence metadata.

---

## Risk management — 7 layers

Every signal is validated before reaching the executor:

| # | Check | What it does |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Supported asset | Rejects assets not supported by the active venue |
| 1 | Leverage cap | Uses the minimum of: signal / platform / `MAX_LEVERAGE` |
| 2 | R:R minimum | Rejects if risk:reward ratio < 1:1 |
| 3 | Live snapshot | Queries the active venue directly (not cached state) |
| 4 | Max positions | Rejects if `MAX_POSITIONS` already open |
| 5 | Margin buffer | Rejects if free collateral < `MIN_FREE_MARGIN_PCT` |
| 6 | Max exposure | Caps total notional at `MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_PCT` of equity |
| 7 | Step size | Rounds base amount to market step; rejects if below minimum |

---

## Supported assets

Supported assets are venue-specific and come from the active venue adapter. Signals for unsupported assets are rejected with an explicit log entry before execution.

See [../docs/en/venues.md](../docs/en/venues.md) for the current backend model and readiness status.

---

## NPM scripts

These scripts are shortcuts for development. In production, always use `./start.sh`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Bot (modules per `.env`) |
| `npm run dev` | Bot with hot-reload (`--watch`) |
| `npm run paper` | Override: paper trading mode |
| `npm run web` | Override: force-enable web dashboard |
| `npm run full` | Override: force web + control bot |
| `npm run full:paper` | Override: full stack in paper mode |
| `npm run monitor` | CLI monitor standalone |
| `npm run monitor:paper` | CLI monitor in paper trading mode |

> npm scripts bypass secrets file loading — they call `node src/index.js` directly. Use `./start.sh` for production and systemd.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Runtime | Node.js 20+ |
| Telegram signals | GramJS (MTProto) — monitors private channels as a user client |
| Telegram control | node-telegram-bot-api — bot with InlineKeyboard |
| Execution backends | Venue adapters using backend-specific SDKs/APIs |
| Web dashboard | Express + Socket.IO |
| Logging | Winston + daily rotation |
| Process manager | systemd (production) |

## Risks and warnings

- **Leverage** can result in full position liquidation
- **RPC/API latency**: use reliable backend endpoints in production
- **Telegram session expiry**: renew `telegram_session.txt` in `/opt/bot/secrets/` periodically
- **Signal quality**: the bot executes any valid signal from the monitored channel — you are responsible for the signal source
- Start with `POSITION_SIZE_PCT=0.01` (1%) and `PAPER_TRADING=true` for at least 24h before going live
- Keep the required fee/gas asset available for your selected backend
- **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**
